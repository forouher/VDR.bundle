VDR.bundle
==========

This is a Plex plugin to properly scan VDR recordings.

Installation
------------

* Clone this repository into ".../Plex Media Server/Plug-ins/"
* Symlink/move "Resources/Movies/VDR Recordings Scanner.py" to ".../Plex Media Server/Scanners/Movies/"

Usage
-----

Afer restarting Plex you should see both a new "Scanner" and a new "Agent" under
"Advanced Options" when adding a new Library.

Usage scenarios:

1. "VDR Recordings Scanner" + "VDR Recordings Importer" as Agent

One video will be added to the library for each VDR recording.
Metadata will be extracted from the data VDR stored with the recording.

This is most useful if most of your recordings are unlikely to get matches at online movie databases.

2. "VDR Recordings Scanner" + default Plex Agent

One video will be added to the library for each VDR recording.
The primary video title will be used to scrape metadata from online databases.

Limitations
-----------

* Will only work with the newer ".ts" VDR recordings

TODO
----

* VDR recordings of TV series are recognized as movies.
* Sometimes Plex gets very slow or stalls when using either this agent or scanner.
